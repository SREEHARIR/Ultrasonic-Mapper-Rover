# Ultrasonic Mapper Rover

An autonomous vehicle which can map the area surrounding it using an ultrasonic sensor mounted on it. Implement SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping) to a rover and then use that data to create a 3D map of the area surrounding it. The rover is a differential drive vehicle, powered by dc motors and LiPo battery. The distance measuring sensor (Ultrasonic sensor) is placed on a rotating platform mounted on the rover for mapping the surroundings. The rotating platform is comprised of a static mount and a servo motor. The distance measured along with angle of the radar, movement parameters of the rover is sent wirelessly to a central hub (laptop) and the software running on the central hub will decode the multiplexed data to display the radar. The radar display is implemented using processing software. Wireless connectivity is achieved using Bluetooth. The User Interface (UI) on the central hub allows the user to manipulate the radar and the movement of the rover. The UI also displays the path the rover has taken in the map. The rover can be asked to stop the mapping and return through the path that it followed. The return trip can also be used as confirmation as the same path will be mapped twice.
